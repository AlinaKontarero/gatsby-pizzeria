# Gatsby app for the cutest pizzeria in the world 

Just because I never reject an option to have a pizza, I made an app for the local pizzeria.

My pet project using JavaScript, Gatsby, React, GraphQL, Headless CMS, and Serverless functions 

Deployed on Netlify: https://best-shire-pizza.netlify.app/
